summary: example package based on GNU hello

  The GNU hello program produces a familiar, friendly greeting.  It allows
  non-programmers to use a classic computer science tool which would
  otherwise be unavailable to them.  Seriously, though: this is an
  example of how to do a Debian package. It is the Debian version of the
  GNU Project's `hello world' program (which is itself an example for
  the GNU Project).
